My project is a simple web page that allows users to input text or a URL, and upon clicking a button, it generates a QR code and displays it on the page. The use of JavaScript and an external QR code generation API enhances the interactivity and functionality of my project.

My project relies on an external resource for generating QR codes. The QR code generation is done by making a request to the "https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/" API.
